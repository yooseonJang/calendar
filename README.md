# calendar
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
I've created this calendar using HTML, CSS, and JS at end of the 2021 summer to incorporate them into a personal use website that I was planning to make.
I've been distracted since then due to school and unexpected events so I haven't had the chance to develop them into something useful. 
Nonetheless this calendar's purpose was to be able to function like apple or google calendar but more personally customized to my needs.
I decided to upload them now since it's just been sitting on my USB drive for so long and hopefully my initiative to upload this on github will motivate me to finish my long forgotten project!
